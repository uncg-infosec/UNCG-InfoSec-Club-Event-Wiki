## Wargames

The following wargame sites are collections of technical challenges that can be done at any time (not just in organized/schedule competitions). Most are security-oriented, but some (like the Bandit wargame at OverTheWire) is more basic tech focused.

* [OverTheWire Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)
* [Smash the Stack](https://www.smashthestack.org/)
* [roothack wargames](http://roothack.org/index.html)
* [Hack this Site](https://www.hackthissite.org/)

The [WeChall Score Aggregator](https://www.wechall.net/) lists many wargame sites (48 active sites in Feb 2023), and collects scoring information from all sites to give uses an aggregate "war games" score. There are individual and country rankings for those that like to be competitive.
